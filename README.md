# Numbers-GNU-Datamash-Wizard
Adds crosstab-like functionality to Mac Numbers using GNU Datamash and JXA 

This is a script that will take a highlighted region in Numbers and present a GUI to summarize with GNU datamash.  It then creates and populates a new table in your Numbers spreadsheet with the result.

TO GET THIS WORKING:
- You need to download GNU Datamash : https://www.gnu.org/software/datamash/ (or use brew/ports)
- You may need to edit the jxa script to include your datamash location.
